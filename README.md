# FSAE 2023
React program for Formula SAE Electric 2023.

This is a React program that receives CAN data (from a JSON file) and displays this data in real-time. If a fault is detected in the race car, then a warning light will display (as seen in the demo). Gauges are created using react-d3-speedometer.
